## Oct. 29 Ceremony to Be Hosted by Criminal Minds Kirsten Vangsness 

The Television Academy today announced the recipients of the 72nd Engineering Emmy Awards honoring an individual, company or organization for developments in broadcast technology. Kirsten Vangsness, who most recently starred on the critically acclaimed CBS drama Criminal Minds, returns to host the awards for the fifth consecutive year. For the first time, the ceremony will stream live on Emmys.com on Thursday, Oct. 29, at 5:00 p.m. PDT.

Engineering Emmys are presented to an individual, company or organization for developments in engineering that are either so extensive an improvement on existing methods or so innovative in nature that they materially affect the production, recording, transmission or reception of television. This year the Academy is recognizing nine companies and five individuals with the prestigious award.

As the television industry has struggled to meet the challenges of a global pandemic, the Academy's Engineering Emmy Awards Committee has selected four companies for recognition in addressing issues related to COVID-19. These organizations have developed and deployed engineering technology that has allowed remote production to continue during this unconventional year.

### Recipients of this recognition are:
